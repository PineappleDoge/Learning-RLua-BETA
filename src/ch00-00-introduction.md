# Introduction

Hi, just before you get to reading, we want to thank you for giving Learning RLua a chance! This book is intended to be an introduction to **RLua**, a Roblox _Modified_ version of Lua. It is meant to go over basic scripting paradigms that RLua has, along with other basic ideas, such as events, services, and objects. We’re going to be supplementing this book with exercises, Q&A, and Quizzes.

As Roblox is a constantly evolving engine, certain services and methods might become **deprecated**, or otherwise outdated. We recommend staying up to date by looking at the official Roblox Developer hub. (<https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/>)

As a note, this book isn’t meant to be a comprehensive guide about every service, method, property, or quirk of RLua. It’s meant to be an introduction into the language and scripting on Roblox. Intermediate and Expert RLua users will get little to no use out of this book, as it’s targeted towards a more beginner audience. We strongly recommend using your search engine of preference to search for answers if you have a question that this book doesn’t answer.
