# Common Programming Concepts

Here we cover concepts that almost every **practical** language has and how they work within RLua. Many languages will have much in common at the core ignoring things like syntax. They all contain the fundamentals of a programming language. None of the concepts presented will be special to RLua but later on we will discuss how they relate to Roblox.

To be more clear this chapter goes over variables, the basic (primitive) types, functions, comments and control flow. You require knowledge of all of these concepts as everything else is built off the fundamentals.
