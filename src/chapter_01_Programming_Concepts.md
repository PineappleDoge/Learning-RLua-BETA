# Chapters 1-4: Basic Programming

In this chapter, we'll cover fundamental concepts that almost every **practical** language has and how they work within RLua. Many languages will have much in common at the core ignoring things like syntax. They all contain the fundamentals of a programming language. None of the concepts presented will be special to RLua but later on we will discuss how they relate to Roblox. 

In this chapter, you can expect us to go over variables, the basic (primitive) types, functions, comments and control flow. These are the fundamental building blocks that you'll need to understand in order to understand the rest of this book, so we strongly recommend coming back to these chapters and trying to understand them. These chapters will try to cover as much information as possible, so as you go through the book, there's a strong informational chapter that you can reference back to. 

Now that this note is out of the way, let's continue to the next section, in which we'll talk about variables, datatypes, and more!
