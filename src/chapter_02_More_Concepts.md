# More Programming Concepts

In the previous chapters, we went over the core fundamentals of programming, including [variables](chapter_11_Variables.md), [datatypes](chapter_12_Datatypes.md), and [control flow](chapter_13_Control_Flow.md). In the next batch of chapters, we'll go over the final "beginner" concepts, before moving on into practical development. This concepts include functions, loops, tables, and other useful values. 

These are still relatively beginner-based, but are slightly more advanced due to requiring knowledge of what we've learnt before. If you don't have a solid grasp of what we've discussed previously, we strongly recommend going back and taking a quick review, then coming back when you feel a bit more comfortable.

Feeling confident? Great! Let's go into our next chapter, [functions](./chapter_21-Functions.md).
