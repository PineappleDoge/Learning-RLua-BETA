# Introduction

Hi, just before you get to reading, we want to thank you for giving Learning RLua a chance! This book is intended to be an introduction to **RLua**, a Roblox _Modified_ version of Lua. It is meant to go over basic scripting paradigms that RLua has, along with other basic ideas, such as events, services, and objects. We’re going to be supplementing this book with exercises, Q&A, and Quizzes.

As Roblox is a constantly evolving engine, certain services and methods might become **deprecated**, or otherwise outdated. We recommend staying up to date by looking at the official Roblox Developer hub. (<https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/>)

As a note, this book isn’t meant to be a comprehensive guide about every service, method, property, or quirk of RLua. It’s meant to be an introduction into the language and scripting on Roblox. Intermediate and Expert RLua users will get little to no use out of this book, as it’s targeted towards a more beginner audience. We strongly recommend using your search engine of preference to search for answers if you have a question that this book doesn’t answer.

## Resources

After reading the book, you should be fluent enough in RLua to understand basic errors, so there's a lot of resources and websites you can use to help yourself fix errors! 
Here are a few websites and techinques that we recommend if you have an issue! 

**Scripting Helpers** - A RLua based website that allows you to make an account and ask for help! If you have a scripting issue, it's always a good idea to look it up here since there's a good chance another person might have the same question as you.

**Roblox Devforums** - A website managed by Roblox themselves. Asking for help here or searching if someone had the same issue as you is always a good idea, and a good last resort is to just post in the appropiate help channel.

**Roblox Developer Hub** - A site that's managed by Roblox themselves. Documents all API for every Roblox service, instance, and object. Useful to double check all properties and methods an object may have.

That's enough talking from us though, we hope you enjoy the book!
